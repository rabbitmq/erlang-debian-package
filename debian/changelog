erlang (1:15.b.1-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved kernel and stdlib include files from erlang-dev to the erlang-base

erlang (1:13.b.4-dfsg-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed bashism in debian/rules (closes: #581450).
  * Added conflict of erlang-doc package with older erlang-base and
    erlang-base-hipe packages to prevent broken situation with erlang-base
    from stable (1:12.b.5) and erlang-doc from testing (1:13.b.4).
  * Added sun-java6-jdk as an alternative build dependency to make backporting

  * Added erlang-doc package which contains documentation in HTML and PDF
    formats. This package replaces erlang-doc-html package and it's easier
    to synchronize it with the main Erlang packages as it's built from
    a single source package (closes: #558451).
  * Removed RPATH from ssl and crypto application binaries as required by
    Debian policy.
  * Added libwxgtk2.4-dev and libwxgtk2.6-dev to build conflicts.

erlang (1:13.b.3-dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=low

erlang (1:13.b.3-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed erlang-manpages package section.

    aren't built at all if only architecture-dependent packages are requested.
  * Fixed project links in README.Debian.
  * Added a new package erlang-jinterface which provides tools for
    communication of Java programs with Erlang processes. This adds build
    dependency on default-jdk and as a result enables Java module for IDL
    compiler.

  * Linked run_test binary from erlang-common-test package to /usr/bin.

erlang (1:13.b.1-dfsg-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Restored debug info in beam files for default build. It's better to use
    more space than to ship broken modules (debugger, dialyzer). The patch
    is simply commented out in debian/patches/series, so if someone has to
    strip debug info, he can simply uncomment it.
  * Disabled SMP support for hurd-i386 architecture, because of FTBFS in case
    when SMP is enabled.
  * Added debian/README.source file with a reference to
    /usr/share/doc/quilt/README.source.

    DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS. By default slim runtime without debug info is built.
    To remove slim option set DEB_BUILD_OPTION to 'nostrip', to add debug_info
    compiler option set DEB_BUILD_OPTION to 'debug'. Or it may be set to

  * Relaxed suggested packages (removed versioned suggests) in debian/control.
  * Adjusted HiPE architecture from ppc64 to ppc if 32-bit code is generated
    (closes: #451505).
  * Commented out native.diff in debian/patches/series because native code

  * Moved several forgotten source directories to erlang-src.
  * Rewritten clean target in debian/rules to ignore only missing Makefile

  * Made clean-patched target in debian/rules depend on patch-stamp.
  * Moved erlang-nox and erlang-x11 menu items from Apps to Applications

  * Overridden lintian warning desktop-command-not-in-package since
    /usr/bin/erl is included into a package on which erlang-nox depends.

  * Removed non-free documentation from the upstream source and added
    dfsg suffix to version number (closes: #393367).
  * Removed conflicts with erlang-doc-html from all packages except
    erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe.
  * Removed conflicts with erlang binary packages from all packages
    (made them just replace earlier versions).
  * Added erlang-src, erlang-examples, and erlang-mode dependency on
    erlang-base (or erlang-base-hipe). It's done only for easier
    packaging.
  * Moved overriding config.sub and config.guess from dpatch
    to debian/rules.
  * Bind Backspace key in Erlang mode for Emacs and XEmacs differently
    (closes: #388851).
  * Added description to all patches in debian/patches.

  [ Torsten Werner ]
  * Set urgency to medium, because we are fixing a RC bug.

erlang (1:11.b.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * New upstream version.
  * Removed 43beam_makeopts.dpatch as it is included in upstream.
  * Overridden lintian complain about missing manual page for dialyzer
    (it is available from erlang-manpages package).
  * Made "make clean" not removing bootstrap files. Otherwise the second
    build cannot be successful.
  * Changed dependencies on erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe to allow
    binary-only NMUs.

  [ Torsten Werner ]
  * add SVN id in README.Debian.

erlang (1:11.b.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Made odbc driver build on 64-bit architectures.
  * Added debian/watch control file.
  * Added link from /usr/lib/erlang/include/driver.h to /usr/include
    (it seems not to conflict with other packages).
  * Disabled optimization for m68k (both -O1 and -O2 do not work,
    see bug #378599).

erlang (1:11.b.0-2) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Added odbc application building (with unixodbc dependency).

  * Merged changes from erlang 1:10.b.10-3, namely:

  * Replaced ibm-linux by ibm-linux-gnu in config.guess.
  * Use -O1 optimization flag for m68k (workaround for bug in GCC, but there
    are still bugs in glibc, so it's unlikely to build erlang on m68k).
  * Corrected erlang-dev short description.
  * Corrected erlang-src.patterns (moved non-source gs application files to
    erlang-x11).
  * Added prerm and postinstall scripts which stop and start erlang-dependent
    services (otherwise certain services, e.g. ejabberd become irresponsible
    after upgrading erlang).
  * Removed gawk from Build-Depends (mawk is required package and is
    sufficient), replaced perl5 by perl because perl5 is a virtual package
    and can't be installed.
  * Moved erlang.xpm to /usr/share/pixmaps.
  * Added erlang.desktop to /usr/share/apps/konsole directory making
    possible to start erlang from Konsole menu.

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Fixed erlang-x11.menu (Erlang Toplevel requires terminal).
  * Applied patch, which fixes large list matching bug on 64-bit
    architectures (see
    http://www.erlang.org/ml-archive/erlang-questions/200606/msg00372.html
    and http://www.erlang.org/ml-archive/erlang-questions/200606/msg00425.html).
  * replaced "-include" for "include" in debian/rules to make get-orig-source
    target working in any directory (see section 4.8 of Debian Policy Manual).

  * As a side effect Erlang can be built on GNU/Hurd now.
  * Added patch for building Erlang on Sparc (Closes: #328031).
  * Added erlang-dev package, containing development files (C-interface
    headers and libraries, Erlang/OTP application headers). Closes: #367614.
  * Added erlang-examples package, containing Erlang/OTP application
    examples.
  * Cleaned up debian/rules script, added the possibility to configure
    Erlang without kernel poll support (useful for kFreeBSD and Hurd
    architectures).

erlang (1:10.b.9-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Sergei Golovan noticed that on platforms supporting HiPE, erlang-
    base and erlang-base-hipe and configured the same way.  Fixed.
  * New maintainers: Erlang Packagers
  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Removed unused files (updvsn, preservebeam, extrafiles, erlang-doc.docs,
    *.install).
  * Removed unnecessary patches from patches/00list.
  * Made templates from erlang-base.links, erlang-mode.links,
    erlang-base-hipe.links. Replaced explicit version numbers to version
    templates.
  * Corrected dependencies in control file (replaced erlang-base-hipe by
    erlang-base because erlang-base-hipe is not always available, made all
    packages conflict with erlang-manpages and erlang-doc-html with
    incompatible versions).
  * Cleaned up lintian override files.
  * Made installing erlang with and without HIPE to debian/erlang-hipe and
    debian/erlang-std respectively (making debugging easier). Rewrote install
    part of the script (made it removing some src files and object files from
    ssl and crypto applications). Made some cleanups in rules.
  * Fixed warnings of missing final newline in several files.
  * Added menu entries to erlang-nox and erlang-x11 packages (since they use
    /usr/bin/erl which is not present in these packages, there are also new
    entries in lintian override files).
  * Added supervisor performance improvement patch
    (http://support.process-one.net/browse/EJAB-19).
  * Added epoll support patch
    (http://developer.sipphone.com/ejabberd/erlang_epoll_patch/).
  * Restored patch which makes erl -man searching manual pages in the
    standard locations.
  * Moved sasl and stdlib beams from erlang-nox to erlang-base-hipe and
    erlang-base packages making them usable without erlang-nox.
  * Closes: #367996
  * Replaced Ericcson by Ericsson in control file (Closes: #368808)
  * Added conflicts of erlang-nox, erlang-x11, erlang-base, erlang-base-hipe
    with erlang-src of incompatible version.

  * Closes: #366398: Same has #358410.
  * Closes: #357134: NMU of Luk Claes.  Most of those errors were already
    fixed in the new package.  Thanks.
  * Closes: #358179: Removed the copy of the LGPL in the copyright file.
    I've put the required shorter text.
  * Disabled HiPE build for mips, arm, mipsel, s390 and sparc, in hope
    that it fixes FTBFS on those platforms.
  * Closes: #358410.  erlang-src and erlang-mode are now Architecture:
    all.
  * erlang-nox and erlang-x11 are now built as arch-dependent targets
    since, practically, they depend on one of erlang-runtime to be
    built.
  * Added a link from /usr/lib/erlang/usr/include to /usr/include/erlang
    to fix potential FTBFS of dependencies of Erlang.
  * cant install erlang package (dependencie problem) (Closes: #366398)

  * Closes: #331817, added debconf-2.0 alternative to erlang
    dependencies.
  * Closes: #344118, added a missing "," in Depends in the
    control file.
  * Removed dependency to bash v3, which means Erlang 10.b.9-2 is
    backportable to Sarge thanks to Sergei Golovan.
  * 10.b.9-1 was a test version that was announced on the erlang-
    questions mailing list.
  * erlang-manpages: Manpages are not where erl -man looks for them

    and MANSECT=1:3erl:4:6.
  * /usr/bin/ear is a dangling symlink (Closes: #346548)
  * Removed ear, ecc, elink, escript, which are bad links produced even
    by the standard erlang install (I sure should ask erlang-questions
    about those).

  * Source files (*.erl, *.hrl, *.c and *.h) are now put in their own

  * Well, I have dpatch'ified the thing but since I now use svn-
    buildpackage locally, the patches are not rather useless.
  * Closes: #333853
  * Closes: #331817
  * Major rules overhaul.  I've had some problems getting some targets
    to run twice but I worked around them.

  * new upstream version
  * fully dpatch'ified.
  * Emacs editing mode pulled from the main package and put into it's
    own erlang-mode package.
  * As it was suggested a few times, I've split the main arch-
    independent package in two.  There is now an erlang-nox package
    which include the base applications that don't require tk8.4 to
    work.  The applications that depend on gs and thus on tk8.4 and now
    in erlang-x11.
  * The files that go in the 3 packages are now determined using regular
    expressions.  See analyse.sh for details.

  * I've simplified the aggressive cleaning done in the clean phase of
    debian/rules.  It doesn't mean that it was wrong, but right now I
    don't fully understand the need for it.  I take care of preserving
    the pristine content of the bootstrap directory instead of using the
    weird preservebeam script.  I suspect that might be causing some
    problems on some platforms although I don't really know why.

    external Erlang programs make this assumption.  Going back to
    conflicting with Elastic.

erlang (1:9.0-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix some lintian warnings.
  * Move all Java stuff into erlang-base, declare as binary-indep, and
    remove build-depends on Java (since autobuilders don't need to build
    these parts.)  Since the java-stuff is not critical to the function
    of Erlang, modify build rules to ignore failure if 'javac' does not
    exist, for example.
  * Incorporated translations for German, Spanish, and Japanese.

erlang (1:9.0-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * More fun with 'ecc'.  I stupidly copied this into my own /usr/bin, so of
    course everything works just fine on my system.  I figured out where this
    is referenced in the erlc source and *hopefully* have this fixed so it
    can coexist with the 'elastic' compiler.  (Closes: #172931)
  * Changed dependency to xlibs-dev (Closes: #170156)

erlang (1:9.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Well, it appears bad paths continue to be a problem.  With some
    messy sed scripts, this is now corrected.  "INSTALL_PREFIX" does
    not seem to be honored by the installation rules from Ericsson
    (unfortunately).

 -- Brent A. Fulgham <bfulgham@debian.org>  Wed, 13 Nov 2002 23:31:55 -0800

erlang (1:9.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Correct a link to epmd in the runtime.
  * Provide a menu entry.
  * Add a conflict with the 'elastic' compiler, which also defines
    a /usr/bin/ecc. (Closes:Bug#168407)
  * Use "INSTALL_PREFIX" to avoid all of those bad paths in the compiled
    scripts.  Surprised no one saw this!

erlang (49.1-9) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Add a tiny patch to avoid a duplicate case clause on Sparc, because the
    latest /usr/include/asm/signal.h files have the same value for
    SIGLOST and SIGPWR. Closes an unreported important bug (this package
    could not be rebuilt on Sparc). This 4 lines patch is the only code
    change in this revision.
  * Add libncurses5-dev to the Build-Depends list. Closes: #58151.
