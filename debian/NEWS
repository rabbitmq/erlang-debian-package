erlang (1:21.2.2+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  The epmd.socket and epmd.service units, which serve the Erlang portmapper
  daemon, are now enabled by default and the socket is listening on all
  the network interfaces. If you want to reconfigure or disable them,
  please consult README.Debian.
